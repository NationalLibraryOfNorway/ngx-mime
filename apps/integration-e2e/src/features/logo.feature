Feature: Displaying logo
  In order to strengthen my brand identity
  As a individual or organization associated with the resource
  I want my logo to be clearly rendered when the resource is displayed or used

  Background:
    Given the viewer is opened with a publication

  Scenario: Show logo in descriptive metadata
    Given the viewer is in dashboard view
    And the viewer is in metadata view
    Then the logo associated with the resource are displayed to the user
